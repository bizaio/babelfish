# babelfish-cdr
The Babelfish Payload Converter enables the efficient translation of payloads associated with Open Banking specifications to and from Java and JSON representations as well as between versions of various payload types. It is initially focused on the Consumer Data Right and is currently being developed by Biza.io as part of it's DataRight.io initiative.

## Unsupported Components
BankingProductRateTier.subTier - We believe this is being deprecated at the moment.

## TODO

Add tests to do JSON -> POJO -> JSON verification beyond static object generate and compare
